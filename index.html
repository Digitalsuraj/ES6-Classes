    <h1>OOPs</h1>
    <p>OOPs Stand for Object Oriented Programming System. Before the invention of the OOPs, <br> procedural programming was done in which we created procedures/functions to manipulate <br> the data while the idea
        of Object Oriented Programming is to create objects that can have <br> both data and functions (Properties and methods)
    </p>

    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) <br> and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the object. <br> Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface <br> (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
        var person = {
            fullName : "Suraj Kumar",
          };
          
          alert(person.fullName); // Suraj Kumar
          person.fullName = "Abhishek Jain";
          alert(person.fullName); // Abhishek Jain
    </pre>

    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction in computer programming is a way to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and <br> implementation in complex software systems. It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler APIs.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
        class ImplementAbstraction {
            // method to set values of internal members
            set(x, y) {
              this.a = x;
              this.b = y;
            }
          
            display() {
              console.log('a = ' + this.a);
              console.log('b = ' + this.b);
            }
          }
          
          const obj = new ImplementAbstraction();
          obj.set(10, 20);
          obj.display();
          // a = 10
          // b = 20
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <h2>Inheritence</h2>
    <p>Inheritance is basically the way through which we share common functionalities among classes. <br> So in other ways, it gives the power to avoid code duplication in a class, by borrowing the <br> functionalities from the other class which possesses those functionalities.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
        const arr = ["C", "C++", "Java", "Javascript"];
        arr.__proto__;
        arr.__proto__.__prot__;  
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism is the technique through which we can substitute classes that have common <br> functionality in terms of their properties and methods.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
        function Animal(sound) {
            this.sound = sound;
            this.speak = function () {
              return this.sound;
            };
          }
          
          function showInfo(obj) {
            console.log(obj.speak());
          }
          
          const dog = new Animal("woof");
          const cat = new Animal("meow");
          
          showInfo(dog);
          showInfo(cat);
          
    </pre>
    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>Classes were introduced in ES6 or ECMAScript 2015. Classes are used to basically create templates <br> which can be used later on to create objects instances.
        The Constructor method inside the classes <br> allows us to initialise the values of instances as we had done before the ES6 was introduced with <br> the help of functions.
        Since the main idea behind OOP is that everything can be imagined in the <br> form of objects and JS being one of the language that supports that fact, so introduction of <br> Classes did make a sense.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
        class Rectangle {
            constructor(){
                console.log('A rectangle is created');
            }
        }
        
        const r1 = new Rectangle(); // A rectangle is created
        class Rectangle {
            constructor(length, breadth){
                this.length = length;
                this.breadth = breadth;
            }
        }
        
        const r1 = new Rectangle(8, 13);
        r1.length; // 8
        r1.breadth; // 13
        class Rectangle {
            constructor(length, breadth){
                this.length = length;
                this.breadth = breadth;
            }
        
            getArea() {
                console.log('Area: ' + this.length * this.breadth);
            }
        
            getPerimeter(){
                console.log('Perimeter: ' + 2 * ( this.length + this.breadth))
            }
        }
        
        const r1 = new Rectangle(8,13);
        r1.getArea();
        r1.getPerimeter();

    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>Inheritance is basically the way through which we share common functionalities among classes. <br> So in other ways, it gives the power to avoid code duplication in a class, by borrowing the <br> functionalities from the other class which possesses those functionalities.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
        class Rectangle {
            constructor(height, width) {
              this.height = height;
              this.width = width;
            }          
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <h3>Super</h3>
    <p>By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods:</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
        class Person {
            constructor(name, age, email) {
              this.name = name;
              this.age = age;
              this.email = email;
            }
          
            getInfo() {
              console.log(
                `Hi my name is ${this.name}, my age is ${this.age} and my email is ${this.email}`
              );
            }
          }
          
          class Doctor extends Person {
            constructor(name, age, email, description) {
              super(name, age, email);
              super.getInfo();
              this.description = description;
            }
          }
          
          const p1 = new Doctor("Manu Prakash", 40, "manup@stanford.edu", "Inventor");          
    </pre>

    <h3>Getters And Setters</h3>
    <p>Getters and setters are basically used to define methods in a class in such way that they can then be used as properties.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
        class Square {
            constructor(side) {
              this.length = side;
              this.breadth = side;
            }
          
            get area() {
              console.log("Area: " + this.length * this.breadth);
            }
          
            set side(area) {
              this.length = Math.sqrt(area);
              this.breadth = Math.sqrt(area);
            }
          }
          
          let s1 = new Square(10);
          s1.area;
          console.log(s1.length); // 10
          console.log(s1.breadth); // 10
          s1.side = 64;
          console.log(s1.length); // 8
          console.log(s1.breadth); // 8
